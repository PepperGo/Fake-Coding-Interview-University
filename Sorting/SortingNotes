Stability:
A sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key, and R appears before S in the original list, then R will always appear before S in the sorted list.
(Not all sorting algorithms are stable)
Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc. And some sorting algorithms are not, like Heap Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
e.g.
Suppose we have a list of 5-letter words:

peach
straw
apple
spork
If we sort the list by just the first letter of each word then a stable-sort would produce:

apple
peach
straw
spork
In an unstable sort algorithm, straw or spork may be interchanged, but in a stable one, they stay in the same relative positions (that is, since straw appears before spork in the input, it also appears before spork in the output).
