CS 61B Lecture 29: Sorting I (https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_EiUvYS2DT6I)

Selection Sort
    Start with empty list S & unsorted list I of n items.
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++){
        x <- item in I with smallest key
        Remove x from I
        Append x to end of S.
    }
    
    
    Whether S is array or linked list, &(n^2) time even in best case


In place(one array): I --> S, I

If S is a balanced search tree, running time is O(n logn)

Replace I with heap?: See heap sort
