Always training on Leetcode seems not a best way, that's why I decide to go over all the fundamentals.

# Fake-Coding-Interview-University
Self-Training Examples from jwasham's Coding Interview University

The difference between jwasham's and this "fake one" is that I will push Java Coding Examples with explanations and thoughts. That's exactly what I wanted to do on my previous project but failed. Thanks to jwasham's study plan. 

Starting from September 13, 2017.
