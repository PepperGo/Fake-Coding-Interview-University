Stacks (video) (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/UdKzQ/stacks)
Stack: Abstrct data type with the following operations:
push(key)
key Top()
Key Pop()

Usage:
Balanced Brackets: 
Input: A String str consisting of '(',')','[',']' characters
Output: Return whether or not the string's parentheses and square brackets are balanced.

Stack can be implemented with either an array or a linked list.
Each stack operation is O(1): Push, Pop, Top, Empty

LIFO: Last In, First Out

Using Stacks Last-In First-Out (video) (https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Using-stacks-last-first-out/149042/177120-4.html)

For Java: Stack (push/ pop/ peek

More complete and consistent set of LIFO stack operations is provided by the Deque Interface and its implementation, which should be used in preference to this class(Stack.
For example:
     Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
