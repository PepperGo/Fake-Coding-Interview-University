Queues (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/EShpq/queue)
Queue: Abstract data type with the following operations:
Enqueue(Key): adds key to collection
Key Dequeue(): removes and returns least recently-added key
Boolean Empty()

FIFO: First-In, First-Out

Queues can be implemented with either a linked list(with tail pointer) or an array.
Each queue operation is O(1): Enqueue, Dequeue, Empty

Circular buffer/FIFO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)

A circular buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.
The useful property of a circular buffer is that it does not need to have its elements shuffled around when one is consumed.
(If a non-circular buffer were used then it would be necessary to shift all elements when one is consumed.)
