Introduction (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/2OpTs/introduction)

Queue:
A queue is an abstract data type supporting the following main operations:
1. PushBack(e) adds an element to the back of the queue;
2. PopFront() extracts an element from the front of the queue.

Priority Queue(Informally)
A priority queue is a generalization of a queue where each element is assigned a priority and elements come out in order by priority.

Typical use case:
(1) Scheduling jobs: 
1. want to process jobs one by one in order of decreasing priority. While the current job is processed, new jobs mayu arrive.
2. To add a job to the set of scheduled jobs, call Insert(job).
3. To process a job with the highest priority, get is by calling ExtractMax().


Priority Queue(Formally)
Definition: priority queue is an abstract data type supporting the following main operations:
1. Insert(p) adds a new element with priority p
2. ExtractMax() extracts an element with maximum priority.

 
Additional Operations:
3. Remove(it) removes an element pointed by an iterator it.
4. GetMax() returns an element with maximum priority(without changing the set of elements)
5. ChangePriority(it, p) changes the priority of an element pointed by it to p.

Algorithms that use priority queues:
1. Dijsktra's algorithm: finding a shortest path in a graph
2. Prim's algorithm: constructing a minimum spanning tree of a graph
3. Huffman's algorithm: constructing an optimum prefix-free encoding of a string
4. Heap sort: sorting a given sequence

Naive Inmplementations (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/z3l9N/naive-implementations)

Unsorted Array/List

Insert(e): add e to the end
           running time: O(1)
ExtractMax(): scan the array/list
              running time: O(n)

Sorted Array:

ExtractMax(): extract the last element
              running time: O(1)
Insert(e): find a position for e (O(log n)) by using binary search, shift all elements to the right of it by (O(n)), insert e (O(1))
           running time: O(n)
           

Sorted List:  

ExtractMax(): extract the last element
              running time: O(1)
Insert(e): find a position for e (O(n); cannot use binary search), insert e(O(1))
           running time: O(n)

                          Insert             Extractmax
Unsorted array/list        O(1)                 O(n)

Binary tree(Actually Binary Heap) (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/GRV2q/binary-trees)

Definition: Binary max-heap is a binary tree(each node has zero, one or two children) where the value of each node is at least the values of its children/
In other words: For each edge of the tree, the value of the parent is at least the value of the child.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Basic operations: 

GetMax: return the root value; O(1)
Insert: attach a new node to any leaf
        this may violate the heap property
        to fix this, we let the new node sift up
        for this, we swap the problematic node with its parent until the property is satisfied
        
        invariant: heap property is violated on at most one edge
                   this edge gets closer to root while sifting up
        Running time: O(tree height)
ExtractMax: replace the root with any leaf
            again, this may violate the heap property
            to fix it, we let the problematic node sift down
            for this, we swap the problematic node with larger child until the heap property is satisfied
            we swap with the larger child which automatically fixes one of the two bad edges
            running time: O(tree height)
ChangePriority: change the priority and let the changed element sift up or down depending on whether its priority decreased or increased
                running time: O(tree height)
Remove: change the priority of the element to &(& means infinity), let it sift up, and then extract maximum
        now, call ExtractMax
        running time: O(tree height)
        
Summary: GetMax works in time O(1), all other operations work in time O(tree height)
         We definitely want a tree to be shallow(complete binary tree).

Complete Binary Trees(https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/gl5Ni/complete-binary-trees)
How to keep a tree shallow? (Complete Binary trees != AVL tree)
Definition: A binary tree is complete if all its levels are filled except possibly the last one which is filled from left to right.
!!!!!!!! 1. The last level is filled from left to right!!!!!!
!!!!!!!! 2. Other levels are filled!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. First Advantage: Low Height
Lemma: A complete binary tree with n nodes has height at most O(logn)

2. Second Advantage: Store as Array
   parent(i) = i/2]
   leftchild(i) = 2i
   right child(i) = 2i + 1
   
What do we pay for these advantages?
We need to keep the tree complete.

Which binary heap operations modify the shape of the tree?
Only Insert and ExtractMax(Remove changes the shape by calling ExtractMax).

Keep the Tree complete:
to insert an element, insert it as a leaf in the leftmost vacant position in the last elvel and let is sift up.
to extract the  maximum value, replace the root by the last leaf and let it sift down.

Pseudocode(https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/HxQo9/pseudocode)

General Setting:
maxSize: is the maximum number of elements in the heap
size: is the size of the heap
H[1 ... maxSize] is an array of length maxSize where the heap occupies the first size elements

   parent(i) = i/2]
   leftchild(i) = 2i
   right child(i) = 2i + 1

SiftUp(i):
while i > 1 and H[Parent(i)] < H[i]:
    swap H[Parent(i)] and H[i]
    i <- Parent(i)
    
SiftDown(i):
maxIndex <- i
l <- LeftChild(i)
if l <= size and H[l] > H[maxIndex]:
   maxIndex <- l
r <- RightChild(i)
if r <= size and H[r] > H[maxIndex]:
   maxIndex <- r
if i != maxIndex:
   swap H[i] and H[maxIndex]
   SiftDown(maxIndex)

Insert(p):
if size = maxSize:
   return ERROR
size <- size + 1
H[size] <- p
SiftUp(size)

ExtractMax():
result <- H[i]
H[i] <-H[size]
size <- size - 1
SiftDown(1)
return result

Remove(i)
H[i] <- @
SiftUp(i)
ExtractMax()

ChangePriority(i, p)
oldp <- H[i]
H[i] <- p
if p > oldp:
   SiftUp(i)
else:
   SiftDown(i)
   
Summary:
The resulting implementation is:
1. fast: all operations work in time O(log n) (GetMax even works in O(1))
2. space efficient: we store an array of priorities; parent-child connections are not stored, but are computed on the fly
3. easy to implement: all operations are implemented in just a few lines of code

Lecture 24: Priority Queues(https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_yIUFT6AKBGE)
Entries consist of key and value.
A total order is defined on the keys. 
Operations:
1. Identify or remove entry whose key is lowest.(but no other entry)
2. Any key may be inserted at any time.
